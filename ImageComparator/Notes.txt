The method of comparing images based on the sum of the luminance of the individual color components is insufficient for diagnostic applications. 
The comparison of images by this method is one-dimensional, resulting in the possibility of false similarities.

Algorithm works well for sorting images that belong to groups with well-defined features.
Modification of the algorithm from RGB components to the six color groups of the HSV model improved the image separation capabilities.
